HOW TO ADD SUPPORT FOR A PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It's extremely simple. All you have to do is tell Crunchbox
where the program's config file is located. If you know minimal Python,
you will figure out right away. If you know 0 python, follow steps below.

Look at plugins that ship with Crunchbox. 

Say you want to add support for Openbox(which is there already. Just using for example).

1) Create file openbox.py inside the plugins directory.

2) Copy the content of (ie, tint2.py) into openbox.py

3) Change the class name on line #4. So "class Tint2: " becomes "class Openbox: "

4) Change the line that is the path to the config file in your system.
   So in our case, we would change the line
   -> self.cfg = [ expanduser("~/.config/tint2/tint2rc) ]
   to make it look like
   -> self.cfg = [ expanduser("~/.config/openbox/rc.xml") ]

5) Inside the load method, we tell Crunchbox what command to run to restart the program.
   Notice that inside tint2.py, we have:
   
   call('killall tint2; tint2 &') <--- this causes tint2 to restart, with the new cfg!
      
   As another example, look inside openbox.py. We have
   call('openbox --reconfigure')

   You simply write just as you would if you were in a terminal

Q) When i save, the program disappear for about a second, and then appears again.
A) This is intended. This is so the program itself isn't present in your screenshot.
